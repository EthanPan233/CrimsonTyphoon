# Crimson Typhoon - An AI Tank Based on Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction

[Robocode](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/) is a programming game, where the goal is to develop a robot battle tank to battle against other tanks in Java or .NET. The robot battles are running in real-time and on-screen.

Crimson Typhoon, based on reinforcement learning, can beat most other tanks at a winning rate of over 90%.

## Results

Different parameters were tuned, like exploration rate and gamma. Also, on-policy and off-policy learning were tested. The results are shown in the figures attached.

## How to run

First download [Robocode](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/).

Then clone repo.

Then run the code. You can grab a coffee, or maybe two, while your Crimson Typhoon is fighting on the battlefield.
